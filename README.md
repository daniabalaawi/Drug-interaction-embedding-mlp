# Drug–Drug Interaction Prediction with MLP + Embeddings

This project predicts **drug–drug interactions (DDIs)** using a feedforward **Neural Network (MLP)** with **embedding layers**.  
The model is trained on the **TWOSIDES dataset** to learn drug representations and classify whether an interaction occurs.
